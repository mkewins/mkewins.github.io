      <h2>July 2020 - Civic Hall Toronto, Monitoring & Evaluation Virtual Panel</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_flashcrow" target="_blank">MOVE</a> is a collaboration between the City of Toronto and Code for Canada. We're building a centralized data platform for the City's collision and traffic count data where employees (and hopefully soon, the public) can access and explore this data to inform decision-making and use it in analyses of traffic-related interventions in Toronto. Ultimately, the goal is to make our streets safer for all.

        <br />
        <br />

        The Big Data Innovation Team is interested in exploring the impact MOVE is having within the City. To do that, we're using a monitoring and evaluation framework to establish a theory of change towards a more open and product-first City, facilitated by Code for Canada. Aakash (Team Lead) & I spoke about the beginning of our journey into monitoring and evaluation for MOVE: the problem space, and the early stages of our theory of change development.
