      <h1>Project: Backyard Demolition</h1>

      <p>In January 2017, I visited my grandparents' house and noticed &mdash; more than
        ever before &mdash; that their backyard was in a state of neglect. Their deck
        was completely rotting away; gardening tools strewn everywhere.
        Old planter pots gathering precipitation, a huge awning rusting and
        crumbling, and an old garden hut caved in on itself. The back half of their
        property was <strong>completely unusable</strong>.</p>

      <p>I knew that I would have some free time in the coming summer, so I went
        back in April 2017 to discuss redoing their backyard as a summer
        project.</p>

      <h1>Initial consultation</h1>

      <p> Pictures of the initial consult show the state of deterioration.</p>

      <h1>Demolition</h1>

      <h2>Teardown and changing project requirements</h2>
      <!-- pictures of 4 weeks of teardown and junk removal-->
        <p>During teardown, the following fixtures were torn down:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Woodworking shed (holes in the roof, back wall)</li>
          <li>Metal shed (completely caved in on itself)</li>
          <li>Vestibule (unnecessary storage space, old, unpermitted)</li>
          <li>Any deck from the back line of the house into the yard (rotting wood)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Therefore the requirements changed slightly.</p>

      <h1>Iterations and final design</h1>

      <h2>Landscaping plan</h2>

      <!-- include images of iterations -->

      <p>After consulting with major primary and secondary stakeholders (clients,
        neighbours, and family members), and iterating through multiple versions
        of the proposed landscape plan for the backyard, a final plan was agreed
        upon with the clients.</p>

      <!-- assuming that this is the final landscape plan, will need to be updated -->
