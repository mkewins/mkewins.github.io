        <h2>January 2021 - Virtual Team Collaboration Seminar</h2>

        <h3>Civic Hall Toronto</h3>

        <p>Navigating the virtual work environment can be challenging. How do you keep everyone in the loop? How do you foster a sense of inclusion and excitement within your team, while you can only see each other as tiny blurred pixels?

        <br />
        <br />

        Led by Maddy Ewins (Code for Canada) and Raphael Dumas (Big Data Innovation Team, City of Toronto), this webinar will empower you to better harness your collaboration skills, and perhaps reassess and rethink your team rituals.

        <br />
        <br />

        This webinar will cover a number of day-to-day communication challenges and we’ll engage in active discussion about problem-solving tailored to different contexts.</p>

        <h2>July 2020 - Monitoring & Evaluation Virtual Panel</h2>

        <h3>Civic Hall Toronto</h3>

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_flashcrow" target="_blank">MOVE</a> is a collaboration between the City of Toronto and Code for Canada. We're building a centralized data platform for the City's collision and traffic count data where employees (and hopefully soon, the public) can access and explore this data to inform decision-making and use it in analyses of traffic-related interventions in Toronto. Ultimately, the goal is to make our streets safer for all.

          <br />
          <br />

          The Big Data Innovation Team is interested in exploring the impact MOVE is having within the City. To do that, we're using a monitoring and evaluation framework to establish a theory of change towards a more open and product-first City, facilitated by Code for Canada. Aakash (Team Lead) & I spoke about the beginning of our journey into monitoring and evaluation for MOVE: the problem space, and the early stages of our theory of change development.
